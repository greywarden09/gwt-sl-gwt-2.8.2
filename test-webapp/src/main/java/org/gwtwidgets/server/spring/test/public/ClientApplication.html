<h1>GWT-SL Unit Test</h1>

<p>This is a unit test for the GWTHandler and the GWTRPCServiceExporter. It requires that the web application is running
    and exposing
    the handler at <code>/handler</code> and the exporter at <code>/exporter</code>. If loaded correctly, it will run
    through
    some tests for the handler and the controller which should not take longer than a couple of seconds.
